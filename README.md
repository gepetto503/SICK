# _SICK._

#### _a health-goth doctor finder_

#### By _**Brendan Hanna**_

## Description

_Are you equally dedicated to H.R. Geiger, Adidas, and Smoothies? Do you wear the most technical sportswear garments with an exclusively black and white color pallet?  If the answer is "what the hell are you even talking about," here's a little light reading on the phenomenon called Health Goth.  For the rest of us, SICK. is a service for locating nearby doctors for those who care as much about their current life as they do their eternal death.  I know, I know: Health Goth has been a thing for a long time and is totally dead now.  But you're not, so find a doctor!_
